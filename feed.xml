&lt;p&gt;Use the analog module to play around with electrical voltage and current, experience Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s law through current flow simulation and voltage display by color, and build logic gates from real MOSFETs, but don’t expect Antares to be a fully-fledged analog simulator tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth mentioning is the new feature #641: Antares now highlights coinciding pins not connected by a wire, a situation that can occur after copy/paste or after moving components with arrow keys, and that could lead to confused users and circuits not working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope to detect hidden bugs and identify missing features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve chosen to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&quot;&gt;Ben Eaters’s 8-bit computer&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fantastic series of videos. Ben Eater does a great job in explaining from scratch how computers work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve reached end of video “8-bit CPU control logic: Part 1”, where every components of the computer can be manually tested using a series of control signals. All went quite well so far, and this is how the main circuit looks like in Antares:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/posts/8-bit-CPU-control-logic-Part-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Analog Components&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already found some bugs and missing feature. Some of them are already added to the project’s issue tracker, and some of them are even already fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building the project with Antares, I especially appreciate Antares’ “Symbol control” feature, which allows me to hide the internal circuitry of the individual components, and still be able to interact with the subcircuits using LEDs and switches in the symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now looking forward to build the control logic!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andreas Fleischmann</name></author><summary type="html">Some of you may have noticed that I’ve decided it’s time to do a circuit project using Antares on my own, so I can experience myself how it’s like to use Antares.

current usage statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever Antares is started on your PC, it makes a call to our usage statistics server located 
in the cloud. This service is completely anonymous - all it receives from your installation is a 
UUID Antares has created when it was first started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last 30 days, 444 unique users have been using Antares, 295 of them were using 
Antares for the first time. 108 users are frequent user, meaning that they have been using 
Antares within the last 2 weeks and at least once in the time before these 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average rating users have given is 4.3 out of 5. We’ve received 48 ratings so far. The 
things these users have said they like the most about Antares were “Easy to use (12)”, followed 
by “Large potential (8)”, “Looks good (7)” and “Rich feature set (7)”. The things they liked the 
least were “Other (11)” followed by “Missing features (9)”, “Difficult to use (7)”, “Not 
enough documentation (6)” and “Many bugs (6)”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope that these information show you that your are not the only one who is using Antares. 
Still, if  you have any ideas for how the Antares project can even gain more attention, please 
let us know by opening a discussion issue in GitHub or by sending a mail to the address given at
